# Intro
Using ML techniques is more challenging than it looks for some reasons including...
- Data Preprocessing: 
    - to understand data that comes from different sources with different formats
    - to decide which parameters to use in the model
- Select Algorithm & Framework
    - many problems appears to be similar, and there is no clear guideline for a particular problem 
- Train & Tune Model
    - need to feed data for many iteration, while tuning hyperparameters depending on the progress
- Integrate & Deploy
    - need to setup an environment for deployment
    - need to integrate the trained model into the environment

SageMaker:
- provide a single platform for all those steps (reduce complexity) 
- we can interact with the system using Jupyter Notebook
- we can elastically deploy resources on demand
